# Features

## Java SDK
The template application uses our [Java SDK](https://github.com/WhereIsMyTransport/TransportApiSdk.Java/blob/master/README.md).The SDK can be used to access all features of the API, but here it only uses the Journey Planner.

## MapboxHelper
* Covers alot of the boiler-plate code that has to be written to display a the Journey Planner response model on a Mapbox maps.
* Provides easy to understand examples of how you can extend this to display other WhereIsMyTransport data on Mapbox.

## MapMarkers
* Provides VectorDrawables for use as waypoint map-markers and map pins to mark out the beginning and end of journeys, intermediate stops and lines.

## Simple and easy to understand Main Activity
* An easy way to understand how to piece together a Main Activity with a Main Fragment and a MainViewModel to handle queries to the API.
